Revision history for Perl extension Tie::RangeHash.

0.70 11 Jul 2002
	- _find_node_parent() changed to use iterative search rather than
          recursive search for minor speed improvement and big stack usage
          improvement
	- non-object-oriented calls changed to object-orient calls
          (consistency!)
	- additional comments in POD
	- added SEE ALSO note in POD about Array::IntSpan

0.60 10 Jul 2001
	- added 'fetch_key' method
	- fixed bug with multiple separators warning using array refs as keys
	- corrected tests to require current version, not 0.51
	- minor code tweaks for consistency
	- uses Test::Harness for tests
	- tests no longer use Time::HiRes

	- tweaked the test scripts a bit

0.51  5 Feb 2001
	- array references can now be used as keys
	- improved the working of the invalid key range message from the

	- added objected oriented interface (aliases to the usual routines)

0.50 18 Jan 2001
        - arbitrarily changed version to 0.50 since some of the changes
	  in 0.42 really merit at least that much of a change in version
	  numbers...

0.42 17 Jan 2001
	- modified test suite to compare adding sequential nodes with
	  randomly shuffled nodes in timings
	- changed 'die' to 'croak' in TIEHASH method
	- changed internal object from hash to array
	- other optimizations
	- fixed typos in comments and POD
	- renamed some fields/variables for clarity
	- added TYPE_USER comparison type for consistency

0.41 22 Dec 2000
	- removed 'unbalanced' option from code (it was commented out anyway)
	- updated and added comments in code
	- changed tree nodes from hashes to arrays (this speeds up adding
	  nodes to the tree)
	- fixed typo in warning messages
	- updated code to use Perl 5.6.0 'our' since warnings is 5.6-ish
	- Tie::RangeHash no longer is a Tie::Hash
	- TIEHASH now checks for bad arguments	
	- tweaked/redid comments
	- tweaked Makefile.PL

0.40 11 Dec 2000

	- added DELETE method
	- _find_node() become _find_node_parent for use w/DELETE method
	- fixed bug with adding undef node
	- warnings are now disabled unless Perl is run with the -w flag
	- test.pl will only use Time::HiRes if it is available
	- other misc. changes to test.pl

0.30  9 Dec 2000
	- fixed bug with missing 'require Tie::Hash'
	- overlapping or duplicate STORE now warns rather than dies
	- added EXISTS method
	- fixed bug with passing range keys (low,high) to FETCH
	- Separator can now be a string or a Regexp
	- Use of $Tie::RangeHash::SEPARATOR deprecated
	- various speed optimizations in adding nodes and searching tree
	- improved comments, renamed variables
	- improved documentation
	- changed to work with Perl 5.005 (not tested)
	- added test.pl to distribution

0.20  6 Dec 2000
