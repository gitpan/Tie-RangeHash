NAME
    Tie::RangeHash - Allows hashes to associate values with a range of keys

REQUIREMENTS
    `Tie::RangeHash' is written for and tested on Perl 5.6.0.

    It uses only standard modules.

    The test suite will use `Time::HiRes' if it is available.

  Installation

    Installation is pretty standard:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

HISTORY
    Changes since Tie::RangeHash v0.41

    0.42 17 Jan 2001
	- modified test suite to compare adding sequential nodes with
	  randomly shuffled nodes in timings
	- changed 'die' to 'croak' in TIEHASH method
	- changed internal object from hash to array
	- other optimizations
	- fixed typos in comments and POD
	- renamed some fields/variables for clarity
	- added TYPE_USER comparison type for consistency

SYNOPSIS
      use Tie::RangeHash;

      tie %hash, 'Tie::RangeHash';

      $hash{'A,C'} = 1;
      $hash{'D,F'} = 2;
      $hash{'G,K'} = 3;

      $hash{'E'};           # returns '2'
      $hash{'BB'};          # returns '1'

      $hash{'KL'};          # returns nothing ('undef')

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows hashes to associate a value with a *range* of keys
    rather than a single key.

    A more detailed description can be found in the module's POD docu-
    mentation.
