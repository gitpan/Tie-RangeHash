NAME
    Tie::RangeHash - Allows hashes to associate values with a range of keys

REQUIREMENTS
    `Tie::RangeHash' is written for and tested on Perl 5.6.0.

    It uses only standard modules.

    The test suite will use `Time::HiRes' if it is available.

  Installation

    Installation is pretty standard:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

HISTORY
    Changes since Tie::RangeHash v0.40

    0.41 22 Dec 2000
	- updated and added comments in code
	- changed tree nodes from hashes to arrays (this speeds up adding
	  nodes to the tree)
	- fixed typo in warning messages
	- updated code to use Perl 5.6.0 'our' since warnings is 5.6-ish
	- Tie::RangeHash no longer is a Tie::Hash
	- TIEHASH now checks for bad arguments	
	- tweaked/redid comments
	- tweaked Makefile.PL

SYNOPSIS
      use Tie::RangeHash;

      tie %hash, Tie::RangeHash;

      $hash{'A,C'} = 1;
      $hash{'D,F'} = 2;
      $hash{'G,K'} = 3;

      $hash{'E'};           # returns '2'
      $hash{'BB'};          # returns '1'

      $hash{'KL'};          # returns nothing ('undef')

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows hashes to associate a value with a *range* of keys
    rather than a single key.

    A more detailed description can be found in the module's POD docu-
    mentation.
