NAME
    Tie::RangeHash - Allows hashes to associate values with a range of keys

REQUIREMENTS
    `Tie::RangeHash' is written for and tested on Perl 5.6.0.

    It uses only standard modules.

  Installation

    Installation is pretty standard:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

HISTORY
    Changes since Tie::RangeHash v0.60

    0.70 11 Jul 2002
	- _find_node_parent() changed to use iterative search rather than
          recursive search for minor speed improvement and big stack usage
          improvement
	- non-object-oriented calls changed to object-orient calls
          (consistency!)
	- additional comments in POD
	- added SEE ALSO note in POD about Array::IntSpan

SYNOPSIS
      use Tie::RangeHash;

      tie %hash, 'Tie::RangeHash';

      $hash{'A,C'} = 1;
      $hash{'D,F'} = 2;
      $hash{'G,K'} = 3;

      $hash{'E'};           # returns '2'
      $hash{'BB'};          # returns '1'

      $hash{'KL'};          # returns nothing ('undef')

    There is also an object-oriented interface:

      $hash = new Tie::RangeHash;

      $hash->add('A,C', 1);
      $hash->add('G,I', 2);

      $hash->fetch('H');    # returns '2'

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows hashes to associate a value with a *range* of keys
    rather than a single key.

    A more detailed description can be found in the module's POD docu-
    mentation.
