	- removed randomized test for now

SYNOPSIS
      use Tie::RangeHash;

      tie %hash, 'Tie::RangeHash';

      $hash{'A,C'} = 1;
      $hash{'D,F'} = 2;
      $hash{'G,K'} = 3;

      $hash{'E'};           # returns '2'
      $hash{'BB'};          # returns '1'

      $hash{'KL'};          # returns nothing ('undef')

    There is also an object-oriented interface:

      $hash = new Tie::RangeHash;

      $hash->add('A,C', 1);
      $hash->add('G,I', 2);

      $hash->fetch('H');    # returns '2'

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows hashes to associate a value with a *range* of keys
    rather than a single key.

    A more detailed description can be found in the module's POD docu-
    mentation.
